Create 'Header' component using 'ConnectButton' from web3uikit

Create 'constants' folder and create 'abi.json' and 'contractAddresses.json' and put {} in both the files to make them json compatible, we are getting the data in these files when we deploy the raffle contract or run a node inside the raffle contract folder

Create an 'index.js' file inside 'constants' folder and export all the json files from there

Insert the 'NotificationProvider' tag in '_app.js'
